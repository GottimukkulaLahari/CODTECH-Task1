## Overview of the Project

## Project: Simple Calculator

## Project Description:
The Simple Calculator project is a Python-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator will support functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users will be able to enter two numbers and select an operation to be performed. The result of the operation will then be displayed to the user.

## Objectives:
1.Develop a basic understanding of user input and output in Python.
2.Implement functions to perform arithmetic operations.
3.Handle user input errors gracefully.
4.Provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the calculator.

## Features:
1.**Addition**: Add two numbers.
2.**Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
3.**Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
4.**Division**: Divide one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.

## Components:
1.**User Input**: Prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation.
2.**Arithmetic Functions**: Implement functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3.**Error Handling**: Ensure the program can handle invalid inputs and division by zero.
4.**Output**: Display the result of the chosen operation
