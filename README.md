## Overview of the Project

## Project: Simple Calculator

## Project Description:
The Simple Calculator project is a Python-based application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator will support functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users will be able to enter two numbers and select an operation to be performed. The result of the operation will then be displayed to the user.

## Objectives:
1.Develop a basic understanding of user input and output in Python.
2.Implement functions to perform arithmetic operations.
3.Handle user input errors gracefully.
4.Provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the calculator.

## Features:
1.**Addition**: Add two numbers.
2.**Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
3.**Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
4.**Division**: Divide one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.

## Components:
1.**User Input**: Prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation.
2.**Arithmetic Functions**: Implement functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3.**Error Handling**: Ensure the program can handle invalid inputs and division by zero.
4.**Output**: Display the result of the chosen operation

## Implementation Plan
1. **Define Arithmetic Functions**:
    - `add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
    - `subtract(x, y)`: Returns the difference between `x` and `y`.
    - `multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of `x` and `y`.
    - `divide(x, y)`: Returns the quotient of `x` divided by `y`, with a check to prevent division by zero.

2. **User Interface**:
    - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
    - Provide options for the user to choose an arithmetic operation.
    - Display the result of the operation.

3. **Error Handling**:
    - Handle invalid numeric input.
    - Handle division by zero gracefully.

4. **Main Program**:
    - Integrate all components to create a functional calculator.
